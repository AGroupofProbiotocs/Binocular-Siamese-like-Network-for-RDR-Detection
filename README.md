# Binocular-Siamese-like-Network-for-RDR-Detection
A simese-like CNN for diabetic retinopathy detection using binocular fudus images as input.

## Notes
1. The dataset is downloaded from the official website of the Kaggle [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).
2. By running the file "generate_list", you can generate the lists containing index paths and labels of the fudus images, which are used for training.
